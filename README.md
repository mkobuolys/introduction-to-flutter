## Building

You can follow these instructions to build the app and install it onto your device.

### Prerequisites

If you are new to Flutter, please first follow the [Flutter Setup](https://flutter.dev/setup/) guide.

### Building and installing the Flutter Design Patterns app

```
git clone git@github.com:mkobuolys/introduction-to-flutter.git
cd introduction-to-flutter
flutter pub get
flutter run
